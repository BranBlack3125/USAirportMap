USAirportMap Web Page


This page displays US airports (the map can be zoomed out to view the Alaska and Hawaii as well, but has a default scale and center set to the continental United States). The background map is sourced from CartoDB, airport locations are pulled from a .geojson files derived from the shapefiles located at  https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-small-scale-dataset-airports-of-the-united-states-201207-shapefile, and the state boundaries were acquired from Mike Bostock of D3. The data were accessed from sources provided in the Geog 572 course materials.

The color ramp of the state map indicates the density of airports within each state. The airport icons are clickable. Airport whose icons are clicked that state "Y" are airports with towers, while those whose labels indicate "N" are airports without towers.

The map is projected in Web Mercator.
